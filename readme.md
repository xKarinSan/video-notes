# 🎥 VNotes

**Watch. Snap. Replay. Learn.**

It aims to streamline video-learning for video-learners that have limited time and feel that AI summaries alone are insufficient.


Perfect for learners, developers, and anyone who wants to **save time while learning from videos**.

- 🔍 Extracts metadata and full transcripts from YouTube videos  
- 📝 Generates multiple note types from video transcripts:
  - Summary
  - Content Overview (Coming soon)
  - Explain Like I’m 12 (Coming soon)
- 💾 Saves notes in both `.json` and `.txt` formats for fast local access  
- ⚡ Optimized for read‑heavy workflows — generate once, reuse anytime

## 🔮 Vision & Roadmap
- 🖥️ Develop into a full **desktop app** — distraction-free, browser-free, offline-friendly

- 👐 Embrace **open source** — extensible, hackable, and built with the community
---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Electron** – For the desktop app
- **Typescript** - For the UI logic and helper functions
- **React** - For the UI
- **Langchain** - For the AI summary portion (will be improved in future)
